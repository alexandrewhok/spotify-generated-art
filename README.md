# Spotify Generated Art

This project was carried out in the scope of the subject Computational Design Laboratory during the Master's Degree in Design and Multimedia.

"Spotify Generated art" generates a abstract image based on your last 20 musics listened on Spotify.

This project involved collecting, storing, and visualizing data from Spotify's API. The process consisted of the following stages:

1. Connecting the API: In this stage, we established a connection to the Spotify API and obtained the necessary credentials and authorization.

2. Getting the Data: In this stage, we retrieved the client's information, the last 20 songs listened to, and the audio features for those songs using the API's endpoints.

3. Storage and Organizing the Data: In this stage, we stored the data locally in variables and organized it in a way that made it easy to access and analyze.

4. Visualize the Information with p5: In this stage, we used the p5.js library to create the visualization image.

5. Save and Share: In this final stage, we saved the visualization and shared it with others, showcasing the results of the project.

The app has been developed by: Alexandre Lucas

The visualization was made by using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

(At this time it only runs with the owners data but its going to be added access to multiple users in the future)
